PostScript-PSjoin

This module is a wrapper around the standalone Perl script "psjoin.pl"
by Tom Sato.  All I did was the minimal set of changes to allow Tom's
script to work as a Perl subroutine.

PostScript::PSjoin concatenates several PostScript files and
generates a single PostScript document. The concatenated
PostScript document will be written to the standard output.

The input PostScript files must comply with the DSC (Document Structuring
Convention). psjoin can fail to work depending on the input PostScript file
or combination of the input PostScript files.

    use PostScript::PSjoin;
    psjoin("-p","psfile1.ps","psfile2.ps","psfile3.ps");

psjoin() takes the following options as the first parameter
passed to the function:

-a  Align first page of each documents to odd page, by inserting
    an extra blank page after odd-paged documents - may be useful
    when concatenating two-sided documents.

-s  Try to close unclosed save operators in the input files. This
    option may be useful when input PostScript files have save 
    operators which don't have corresponding restore operators, and 
    the joined PostScript file causes ``limitcheck'' PostScript error 
    due to too deeply nested save operators.

-p  Force insert corresponding PostScript prolog/trailer codes into
    all pages. Normally, to reduce the size of the output file, psjoin 
    tries not to insert largest prolog/trailer codes repeatedly.

-h  Display short description about the program and exit.
