PostScript-PS2tools

This module is a collection of functions for manipulating PostScript files.
There is a separate README file for each of the functions.

There's already a nice-looking module on CPAN called PostScript::Convert
(http://metacpan.org/pod/PostScript::Convert) and it could certainly
replace PS2pdf with much more versatility.  However, it lacks two
capabilities I needed for my PNG conversion: rotation, and image scaling.
psconvert doesn't support those functions directly; it might be able to 
by providing custom input strings.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
